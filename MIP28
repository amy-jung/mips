## Sentence Summary
MIP28 defines the Operational Support domain according to the domain definition template provided in MIP23.


## Paragraph Summary
The Operational Support (OS) domain's key function is to ensure the development and management of distributed operations at MakerDAO. Additionally, the Operational Support domain is responsible for helping domain teams coordinate to complete objectives and manage shared resources. The domain’s main responsibilities fall into three categories:

* General operations for domains 
* Cross-domain team coordination
* Grants management and distribution

## Motivation
As initial domain teams mature and more domain teams emerge, MakerDAO will need a group to support coordination of various teams and ensure resources are allocated effectively across teams. This domain team is focused on supporting other domain teams and serving the best interests of MakerDAO through an operational lens.

Staying true to the nature of decentralized organizations, the Operational Support domain would seek to have domain teams remain independent, yet collaborative for the continued development of the Maker Protocol and MakerDAO members.


## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIP28c1: Operational Support Domain Overview
The Operational Support (OS) domain's key function is to ensure the development and management of distributed operations at MakerDAO. Additionally, the Operational Support domain is responsible for helping domain teams coordinate to complete objectives and manage shared resources. The domain’s main responsibilities fall into three categories:

* General operations for domains
* Cross-domain team coordination
* Grants management and distribution

Naturally, the focus of the domain functions will change with the maturity of MakerDAO. Functions are divided into “Short Term”, which defines temporary responsibilities during early stages of the DAO structure, and “Long Term”, which defines responsibilities that will remain permanently and be refined as the DAO matures.

**Short Term Functions:**

* Bootstrap initial operations of domains that are not yet developed or difficult to scale quickly, such as Finance, HR, Legal, Partnerships, TechOps, etc.
* Bridge and manage resources from Maker Foundation.
* Propose growth focused minimum operational framework and guidance documents.
* Support domain teams transition into DAO structure; support domain teams in initial setups.

**Long Term Functions:**

* Identify potential bottlenecks and opportunities for more effective coordination and resource distribution to domain teams.
* Incubate and provide grants funding for smaller working groups and proto-teams.
* Coordinate domain budget proposals and payments.
* Help new domain teams onboard.
* Manage account permissions to any shared MakerDAO resources (ie. Github, Forum, etc).

### MIP28c2: Operational Support Facilitator Role and Responsibilities
The Operational Support domain will focus on three sectors, ideally with a Operational Support Facilitator in each specialization.

* General Operations
* Cross-Domain Coordination
* Grants

A Operational Support Facilitator has the following responsibilities in addition to those detailed in MIP28c1:  

**General Operations:**
* Ensure resources are distributed outlined by Governance.
* Produce reports for the community on resource funding and spending.
* Research tooling in the ecosystem, and coordinate with partners for potential pilots.
* Set up key metrics and feedback loops to be able to adapt processes as necessary.

**Cross-Domain Coordination:**
* Plan and develop new domain onboarding processes.
* Work closely with Governance to organize and facilitate open communication and collaboration processes that ensure coherence across teams.
* Identify and support key initiatives, facilitate prioritization, and organize the execution of important roadmap initiatives, such as collateral onboarding.
* Support standardization of documentation used to scope, resource, track and archive project developments.
* Strive to improve transparent process and communication.

**Grants:** 
* Produce grant initiatives to incentivize the fulfillment of DAO objectives.
* Improve recruitment to ensure a healthy pipeline of potential grantees.
* Manage grantee payments.

Generally, Operational Support Facilitators must keep the lists in component MIP28c5 and MIP28c6 up to date.

### MIP28c3: Operational Support Facilitator Candidate Criteria
The following criteria should be used when evaluating an individual for the role of a Operational Support Facilitator:  
* Experience in one or more of General Operations (Finance, HR, Legal, TechOps, etc.).
* Experience in project management and managing cross-functional operations.
* Excellent team facilitation skills.
* Able to work collaboratively and communicate effectively in diverse environments with teammates, organizational stakeholders, and community members.
* Should have familiarity with MakerDAO and general understanding of Maker Protocol.
* Should show interest in participation in the MakerDAO community.
* Should have a general understanding of each domain and how they connect.
* Should be comfortable moving projects from ideation to implementation.
* Experience working with distributed teams. (Nice to have)

### MIP28c4: Operational Support Facilitator Removal Criteria
A Operational Support Facilitator should be considered for removal if they are:  
* Displaying biased or malicious behaviour which are not serving in the best interest of domain teams and MakerDAO. 
* Majority domain teams (51%) feel they are not being supported by the current Operational Support Facilitator.
* Misusing resources or favoring one domain over another.
* Absent from their duties for a prolonged period.
* Expressing unwillingness to continue in their role.

### MIP28c5: Operational Support Domain Facilitator List
This list can be amended by the Operational Support Domain Facilitators at any time to reflect the current state of the Operational Support Domain. It is the responsibility of the Operational Support Domain Facilitators to keep this list accurate and up to date.

Entries into this list should follow the following template:

```
Name: 
Sub-proposal Number: MIP28c7-SP#
Date Added: YYYY-MM-DD
Authorized Address: 
```

There are currently no Operational Support Facilitators.

### MIP28c6: Operational Support Contributor List

This list can be amended by the Operational Support Facilitators at any time to reflect the current state of the Support domain. It is the responsibility of the Operational Support Facilitators to keep this list accurate and up to date.

Entries into this list should follow the following template:

```
Name: 
Sub-proposal Number: MIP28c7-SP#
Date Added: YYYY-MM-DD
About me: (paragraph describing qualifications / experience / etc)
```

There are currently no Operational Support Contributors.

### MIP28c7: Operational Support Facilitator Onboarding Component

MIP28c7 is a Process MIP component that allows the onboarding of Operational Support Facilitators using a subproposal. MIP28c7 subproposals have the following parameters:
-   **Feedback Period**: 1 month
-   **Frozen Period**: 1 month

MIP28c7 subproposals must use the template located at  **[MIP28c7-Subproposal-Template.md](MIP28c7-Subproposal-Template.md)**. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.

---

### MIP28c8: Operational Support Facilitator Offboarding Component

MIP28c8 is a Process MIP component that allows the offboarding of Operational Support Facilitators using a subproposal. MIP28c7 subproposals have the following parameters:
-   **Feedback Period**: 0 months
-   **Frozen Period**: 0 month

MIP28c8 subproposals must use the template located at  **[MIP28c8-Subproposal-Template.md](MIP28c8-Subproposal-Template.md)**. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.

Domain Facilitators may voluntarily offboard themselves by filling out the MIP28c8 subproposal template and posting it publicly in the official forum and making a brief public statement on the weekly governance and risk meeting.
